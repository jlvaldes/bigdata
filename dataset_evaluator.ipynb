         My minimum payment for my Fortiva Retail Credit Card is {$63.00} a month. However every time I go to pay my bill my monthly statement is saying my minimum payment is {$110.00} a month. After filing two complaints against Fortiva with the CFPB my minimum monthly payment was reduced to {$63.00}. I was told this back in XX/XX/XXXX by XXXX XXXX a representative from Fortiva Corporate Office.My minimum monthly payment was reduced because I can not/could not pay the prior minimum payment of {$120.00} a month for my furniture purchase from XXXX 's XXXX XXXX which I purchased in XX/XX/XXXX. I was duped into opening a Fortiva Retail Credit Card account by a Sales Representative in XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX.Since my minimum payment was reduced in XX/XX/XXXX every time I go to pay my monthly minimum payment to Fortiva my statement is saying a {$110.00} is due. This is not correct my monthly minimum payment is {$63.00} a month.\n",

US Bank is reporting to them every month that I am over the credit limit. It appears to me that US Bank is selectively ( profiling ) minorities by indicating that I am over the limit to all three credit bureaus. They are selecting what to report instead of reporting accurate account information to the bureaus. \\n\\nI have never went over the credit limit on this account. I have made numerous attempts to resolve the issue with US Bank by requesting a status update letter. However, the letter does not indicate the credit limit. \\n\\nI do believe that they are not practicing in good faith as it relates to addressing concerns of minority Americans. I believe they are targeting minorities by reporting inaccurate information to the credit bureaus every month. \\n\\nI called US Bank and asked them would they tell me the day that my credit card was over the limit or even when I owed {$5000.00} on the credit card, both supervisors that I spoke with told me that I was never over the credit limit.\n",

by DNF Associates today. I never received calls or mail and nobody validated this Debt. I dont know this company DNF? Nobody attempted to call me for any debt or mail me letters for this debt? How is it that this is reported to the credit report without any communication? No letters, no mail, no calls? There were no calls or mail sent to me by any companies so why would they go ahead and add it. This is a violation of the fair credit act and a violation of my rights. I would like this removed from my credit report since it is a violation of the fair credit act. I did not receive and call or any mail to validate any debt. There were no communications received from either company. Please remove this from my credit bureau at once.\n",

       "355    In XXXX of XXXX, Wells Fargo entered into a settlement agreement with the state of Ohio to compensate the state and their victims for their violation of consumer trust. In XXXX, I received a check from Wells Fargo Auto with the memo XXXX XXXX XXXX in the amount of {$48.00}. I began contacting Wells Fargo to let them know this amount doesnt compensate me. Nor does it make up for the impact that their illegalities have had on my life. I have only received rude refusals from Wells Fargo to date, and in one XXXX  call a representative questioned my Covid status. \\n\\nAs a victim of Wells Fargo Dealer Services, I was negatively impacted by the lies and deception of Wells Fargo Bank. As an XXXX XXXX  citizen and tax-payer, I'm appalled that Wells Fargo Bank was allowed to discriminate against me and so many others for so long. I suffered a devastating loss that I'm yet to recover from, and it cost me dearly. \\n\\nI remember how they held my check when I bought my car and the dealer was instructed not to release the vehicle. I remember how they argued with me when I wanted to discuss payment options causing me mental anguish and emotional distress. I remember how my father, a US Veteran of the XXXX XXXX, had to help me financially when Wells Fargo refused to grant me hardship when I lost employment. \\n\\nI remember XXXX weekend of XX/XX/XXXX, getting the call that Wells Fargo ordered repossession of my XXXX XXXX XXXX. \\nThe person who called me, told me coldly that I had a small window to get my belongings. I remember subsequently losing my job the next month because I didn't have a car. I remember subsequently being evicted and being homeless for the next few years, surfing from couch to couch relying on my family because I didn't have a car. I remember my small business grinding to a stop, losing countless opportunities. I remember losing my parents trust, and how I had to explain how Wells Fargo acted. I remember my father saying how it seemed shady. \\n\\nWhat I endured as a result of Wells Fargo and their \" gaming '' and what they've done to my trust as not only a consumer but as a citizen, is traumatic. Their actions forced me into bankruptcy. \\n\\nIn a XXXX  phone conversation with XXXX # XXXX, I was gamed when Wells Fargo disregarded my consumer rights. I requested the default terms of my loan and was informed by someone named XXXX that they would be mailed to me. I never received my terms via mail. I also requested extension on my payment date to redeem my car. I was informed by XXXX # XXXX that Wells Fargo is not required by law to contact me regarding their decision to grant me an extension on my account. \\n\\nXXXX informed me that I was granted an extension until XX/XX/XXXX. However I was never informed of this decision by Wells Fargo. The car moved to auction and I never received the requested information from Wells Fargo. \\n\\nOn XX/XX/XXXX, XXXX XXXX - XXXX received my offer of XXXX to be paid on XX/XX/XXXX. She informed me that two solutions exist, 1 ) email an offer and wait 2-3 biz days for response or 2 ) speak with collection specialist to receive a decision. I was transferred to XXXX to speak with a collection specialist representative as XXXX reported only specialist could make a decision on my offer. \\n\\nXXXX, the collection specialist stated that XXXX gave bad and/or erroneous information. He reported that he had no role in the process. On XX/XX/XXXX, I spoke with representative # XXXX XXXX who informed me that XXXX was unavailable and that she could not confirm the process or provide further information. She only confirmed my offer of XXXX being submitted. \\n\\nOn XX/XX/XXXXXXXX  I placed a call to Wells Fargo and made an offer of a payment of XXXX to redeem my vehicle. The representative refused to document my offer. I was informed on XX/XX/XXXXXXXX  by a representative that I must make payment before XX/XX/XXXXXXXX  or else my vehicle would be auctioned. This contradicted a court letter that informed that the car would not be auctioned on XX/XX/XXXXXXXX  if the account has not been settled. \\n\\nXXXX, a Wells Fargo collections rep, stated that he had no knowledge of redemption process given to me by XXXX. I was transferred to XXXX a Wells Fargo Collection representative who stated that XXXX was his supervisor. He stated that everyone I spoke with provided wrong and/or erroneous information. He stated that he will not supply the terms or policies in writing, citing what he called legal nature of letterhead. '' XXXX stated that he could make no negotiations on behalf of Wells Fargo. \\n\\nAll of these communications equated to gaming tactics meant to willfully violate my consumer rights. I lost relationships, wages, housing, and opportunities due to to these illegal tactics. \\n\\nAs of XX/XX/XXXX I was awaiting XXXX  XXXX, a specialist with Wells Fargo, to return my call regarding this dispute. That call never came. Subsequent calls were negative, and I was being laughed off of the phone. As of XX/XX/XXXX, Im still seeking adequate compensation and Wells Fargo has even declined to share their arbitration clause. \\n\\nI'm seeking adequate compensation from Wells Fargo and have made several unsuccessful attempts contacting Wells Fargo to resolve this matter. I'm seeking assistance from my representatives in contacting Wells Fargo and working toward a resolution. By contacting my US Representative and the US Treasury Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, I want to share how Wells Fargo 's illegal actions and gaming tactics have detrimentally impacted my life. \\n\\nI've received check with the memo XXXX XXXX XXXX in the amount of {$48.00}.

Please see attached emails received on XX/XX/ indicating that all of my accounts are now active and in good standing and that my ability to transfer funds into and out of Synchrony has been reactivated. Although one might think this is good news, I still can not access my account online as you can see from the attached screenshot. When I call Synchrony with my daughter to resolve the issue, Synchrony provides no information on why I am locked out of my account and will not unlock the account. Moreover, Synchrony will not proactively provide information, saying only that we should call again in three days. And during this time, I no access to any of the significant sum in funds that I currently have on deposit with Synchrony - even after Synchrony has stated in writing that all of the accounts are in good standing. In addition to all of this, Synchrony will not return the funds transfer initiated from XXXX XXXX Bank even though Synchrony did not accept the transfer stating in the attached email that I must contact XXXX XXXX Bank to ask them to request the funds. It has now been a full week and still, left and right, Synchrony is blocking and interfering with my access to her own funds without explanation or recourse. This can not be tolerated.\n",

Despite this agreement, Wells Fargo Auto has continued to demand payment and has even threatened to repossess my vehicle. \\n\\nAdditionally, Wells Fargo Auto has been purposely misapplying my payments, resulting in inaccurate account balances and additional fees. This behavior is a clear violation of consumer protection laws, including the Fair Credit Reporting Act and the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act. \\n\\nFurthermore, my research has revealed that Wells Fargo has a history of similar behavior. In XXXX, the CFPB fined Wells Fargo {$100.00} million for opening unauthorized accounts and charging customers for services they did not request. This is evidence of a pattern of unethical and illegal behavior by Wells Fargo, which warrants further investigation and action by the CFPB. Most recently they have been charged again for illegal practices, their executive office is unprofessional and uneducated and poses a threat to the life and liberty outlined in the Constitution of this great Nation. Accord and Satisfaction is a write of the people to discharge debt and their ignorance of the law is no excuse in law. \\n\\nI request that the CFPB investigate this matter and take appropriate action against Wells Fargo Auto for their failure to honor an accord and satisfaction agreement, their intentional mishandling of payments, and their violation of consumer protection laws. Thank you for your attention to this matter. \\n\\nSincerely, XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX  settlor References : Fair Credit Reporting Act : https : //www.consumerfinance.gov/policy-compliance/rulemaking/regulations/602/fair-credit-reporting-act/ Fair Debt Collection Practices Act : https : //www.consumerfinance.gov/policy-compliance/rulemaking/regulations/807/fair-debt-collection-practices-act/ CFPB fines Wells Fargo {$100.00} million : https : //www.consumerfinance.gov/about-us/newsroom/cfpb-fines-wells-fargo-100-million-widespread-illegal-practice-secretly-opening-unauthorized-accounts/ CASES regarding accord and satisfaction : Peters v.

accounts ) that multiple cards were being opened or trying to be opened in my name. I called XXXX and together we called the various credit card companies. \\nI thought all the accounts had been closed. I put a freeze on any future account being opened with the 3 credit bureaus. \\nToday, I looked at my credit report, and saw that one of these accounts that was opened was still open. And my credit score plummeted by XXXX points as payments have not been made on it. \\nI called XXXX immediately . They had me call XXXX and XXXX. XXXX insists on this identity theft report being filed. I did not know anything about this report. Nothing was mentioned to me a year ago about filing out this report. \\nI called Wells Fargo today ( where the credit card is issued in my name and has a balance ). Wells Fargo is opening up a fraud report. \\nThis should not be such a difficult problem for a fraud victim to overcome. Thank you for your help.\n",
